            <p>Each day is a new day, after all. Which means there will always be more code to type and debug.</p>

            <p>:3, an upcoming coder in the developer world known for their love of video games, has a knack for coding and enjoys updating their personal portfolio website when they have the time. Although, they say they love to code they are rather quick to knaw their teeth at unexpected errors. Only thing that saves them from going insane is the fact that even the most skilled of coders encounter bugs. (Doesn't make it any less bothersome, though.)</p>
